Suggestions for improvement:

1. Configuration:
   Consider creating a separate config.py file to centralize all configuration settings, including those loaded from .env. This can make it easier to manage and update configurations.

2. Error Handling:
   While you're using error handlers, consider implementing more specific exception handling where appropriate.

3. Testing:
   Add unit tests for your functions to ensure they behave as expected under various conditions.

4. Documentation:
   Add docstrings to your functions and classes if you haven't already. This will make your code more maintainable and easier for others to understand.

5. Type Hinting:
   Consider adding type hints to your function parameters and return values for better code clarity and to catch potential type-related errors early.

6. Asynchronous Operations:
   If you're dealing with large datasets or time-consuming operations, consider using asynchronous programming (asyncio) for better performance.

7. Data Validation:
   Implement more robust data validation when inserting data into the database to ensure data integrity.

8. Backup Strategy:
   Implement a backup strategy for your database, especially if you're dealing with important or frequently changing data.

9. Logging Enhancements:
   Consider adding more detailed logging, especially for critical operations and potential error points.

10. Performance Optimization:
    For large datasets, consider using bulk insert operations instead of individual inserts to improve performance.

Overall, your project structure and code organization are solid. These suggestions are meant to further enhance the robustness and maintainability of your application. Great job on setting up a comprehensive system for managing Pok√©mon TCG data!
