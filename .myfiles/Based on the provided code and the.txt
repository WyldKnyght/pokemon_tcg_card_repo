Based on the provided code and the principles you've outlined, here's an analysis and some recommendations for implementation:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):
   - The code generally follows SRP well. Each module and function has a clear, specific purpose.
   - The `populate_db.py` file could potentially be split further. The `load_data` function is handling multiple responsibilities (setting up the database, loading sets, and loading cards). Consider separating these into distinct functions or even separate modules.

2. Separation of Concerns (SoC):
   - The project structure shows good separation of concerns, with distinct modules for different operations (e.g., database operations, data loading, repository updates).
   - The `db_ops_components` directory effectively separates different database operations.

3. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):
   - The code generally avoids repetition, with common operations extracted into reusable functions.
   - The error handling and logging decorators are good examples of DRY principle application.
   - Consider creating a common function for opening and reading JSON files, as this operation is repeated in several places.

4. Efficiency Review:
   - The use of `executemany` for batch inserts is good for efficiency.
   - The retry mechanisms for database operations are a good practice for handling transient errors.
   - Consider using bulk inserts or transactions for large data loads to improve performance.

5. Hard-coded settings/variables:
   - Most settings are appropriately stored in the `Config` class.
   - The `SET_ID_TO_FILENAME` dictionary in `populate_db.py` could be moved to the configuration file.
   - Consider using environment variables for sensitive information or deployment-specific settings.

Recommendations for implementation:

1. Create a common utility function for JSON file operations:
   ```python
   def load_json_file(file_path):
       with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
           return json.load(f)
   ```

2. Refactor `load_data` in `populate_db.py`:
   ```python
   def setup_database(cursor):
       # Database setup operations

   def load_set_data(cursor, schema):
       # Set data loading operations

   def load_card_data(cursor, schema):
       # Card data loading operations

   @error_handler
   def load_data():
       schema = parse_schema(Config.SCHEMA_PATH)
       with get_db_connection() as conn:
           cursor = conn.cursor()
           setup_database(cursor)
           load_set_data(cursor, schema)
           load_card_data(cursor, schema)
   ```

3. Move `SET_ID_TO_FILENAME` to `config.py`:
   ```python
   class Config:
       # ... other config items ...
       SET_ID_TO_FILENAME = {
           'base3': 'base3.json',
           'sm5': 'sm5.json',
           'sv3': 'sv3.json',
           'swsh7': 'swsh7.json',
           'xy6': 'xy6.json'
       }
   ```

4. Implement bulk inserts for better performance:
   ```python
   def bulk_insert(cursor, table, columns, data):
       placeholders = ','.join(['?' for _ in columns])
       query = f"INSERT INTO {table} ({','.join(columns)}) VALUES ({placeholders})"
       cursor.executemany(query, data)
   ```

5. Use environment variables for sensitive information:
   ```python
   import os
   from dotenv import load_dotenv

   load_dotenv()

   class Config:
       DB_PASSWORD = os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')
       API_KEY = os.getenv('API_KEY')
   ```

These recommendations should help further improve the code's adherence to the principles you've outlined, making it more maintainable, efficient, and flexible.
