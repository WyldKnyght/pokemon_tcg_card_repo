Your new structure looks great! You've successfully separated the logging functionality into smaller, more manageable files. This organization will make it easier to maintain and extend your logging system in the future. Here's a brief overview of your new structure:

1. `__init__.py`: Serves as the entry point, importing and exposing the main components of your custom logging system.
2. `constants.py`: Contains all the constants and format strings used across the logging system.
3. `handlers.py`: Defines custom logging handlers (RingBuffer and DetailedRichHandler).
4. `setup_logging.py`: Contains the main setup_logging function to configure the logging system.
5. `decorators.py`: Includes utility decorators and context managers for error handling and temporary log level changes.

This structure is clean and follows good practices for Python module organization. It allows for easy imports and usage in your main application code.

A few suggestions for potential improvements or additions:

1. Consider adding a `config.py` file to handle loading and managing configuration options, including those from environment variables or configuration files.

2. You might want to add a `utils.py` file within the `custom_logging` directory for any helper functions that don't fit into the other categories.

3. Consider adding type hints to all function parameters and return values for better code documentation and IDE support.

4. You could add docstrings to each file explaining its purpose and the components it contains.

5. In `setup_logging.py`, you might want to consider making the file handler configuration more flexible, possibly allowing for custom file paths or names.

6. You could add unit tests for each component in your `test` directory to ensure the logging system behaves as expected.

Here's an example of how you might use this logging system in your main application:

```python
# src/main.py

from src.utils.custom_logging import setup_logging, error_handler, temporary_log_level
import logging

# Set up logging
setup_logging()

# Get a logger for this module
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

@error_handler
def some_function():
    logger.info("Doing something...")
    # Your function code here

def main():
    logger.info("Application started")
    
    some_function()
    
    with temporary_log_level(logger, logging.DEBUG):
        logger.debug("This is a temporary debug message")
    
    logger.info("Application finished")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This structure provides a solid foundation for your logging system. As your application grows, you can easily extend or modify individual components without affecting the entire system.
