# Custom Logging System Overview

Here's a brief overview of your custom logging system structure:

1. `__init__.py`: Serves as the entry point, importing and exposing the main components of your custom logging system.

2. `constants.py`: Contains all the constants and format strings used across the logging system.

3. `handlers.py`: Defines custom logging handlers (RingBuffer and DetailedRichHandler).

4. `setup_logging.py`: Contains the main setup_logging function to configure the logging system.

5. `decorators.py`: Includes utility decorators and context managers for error handling and temporary log level changes.

6. `setup_file_logging.py`: Provides functionality for setting up file-based logging for update operations.
   - `setup_file_logging()`: Creates a new log file for each update session with a timestamp.
   - `get_update_logger()`: Returns a logger configured for update operations.

Key Features:
- The system uses a combination of console and file-based logging.
- It includes a ring buffer for maintaining recent log messages in memory.
- Custom handlers provide rich console output and detailed formatting options.
- File-based logging for updates includes the filename and function name in each log entry for easier debugging.
- The logging level can be dynamically set through environment variables.
- Error handling and temporary log level changes are facilitated through decorators and context managers.

This structure provides a flexible and comprehensive logging system that can be easily customized for different parts of your application while maintaining consistency in log formats and handling.
